-- This script will install all of the objects necessary for Temporal Data Capture (TDC)
-- Since there is no msdb in which to create the objects, the script must be run in each 
-- database in which TDC will be used

-- Two schemas are created - tdc (used for TDC code) and history (where the temporal portion of tables will reside)
-- Additionally I create a tdc user and set them as the owner of the tdc schema

-- Once the database has been enabled for TDC (excuting this script also performs that action) you must also
-- enable the individual tables by executing exec [tdc].[tdc_enable_table] <schema>, <table>, 0 the 0 indicates SQL Database.

-- this can also be deployed on premise by passing a 1. This installs three messages in sys.messages for use by TDC.
-- one benifit this could bring would be to use TDC on premise but stretch the history table to Azure.
